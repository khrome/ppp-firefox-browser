ppp-chrome-browser
==================

A [`peer-pressure`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peer-pressure) plugin to run tests in the [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) browser through [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer)


Install
-------

```bash
npm install --save ppp-chrome-browser
```

installation for the firefox dependency [is kind of off](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer#q-which-firefox-version-does-puppeteer-use) while the plugin is still ["experimental"](https://puppeteer.github.io/ispuppeteerfirefoxready/). Sorry about that.

Usage
-----

Refer to the [`peer-pressure`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/peer-pressure#configuration) docs.

Testing
-------

```bash
mocha
```
